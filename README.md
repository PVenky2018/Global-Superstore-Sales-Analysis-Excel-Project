#Project: Global Superstore Sales Analysis (Excel)

This project aimed to analyse sales performance and regional management effectiveness for the Global Superstore using Excel-based analysis and dashboard creation. The dataset consisted of two worksheets:

-	Orders: Contained transactional data including order details, customer information, product categorization, pricing, and geographical information.   
-	Regional Head: Linked regional sales performance to specific sales representatives.
  
##Key Analyses Performed:
-	Sales Revenue Analysis: Calculated the total sales revenue across all regions (Dashboard 1 shows the overall total). Identified the sales revenue by each region, enabling a comparison to find the highest and lowest performing regions (Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2 both visualize regional sales, allowing for this comparison).   
-	Regional Head Performance: Evaluated and ranked top-performing regional heads based on total sales revenue (Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2 display and rank regional heads by sales).   
-	Sales Trend Analysis: Analysed sales trends over time on a monthly basis (Dashboard 1 shows monthly sales trends).   
-	Product Performance: Identified top-selling product sub-categories based on total sales revenue (Dashboard 1 shows the top 7 sub-categories by sales).   
-	Sales Distribution: Determined the distribution of sales across different regions, showing the percentage contribution of each region to the total (Dashboard 2 uses a pie chart to visualize this distribution).   
-	Average Order Value (AOV): Calculated the average order value for each region, allowing for comparison of customer spending habits across regions (Dashboard 2 specifically visualizes AOV by region).   
-	Order Volume Analysis: Compared the number of orders across different regions to understand regional demand (Dashboard 2 includes a chart comparing order numbers by region).   
-	Regional Head Contribution: Quantified each regional head's contribution to the total sales revenue, showing individual impact (Dashboard 2 uses a stacked bar chart to illustrate individual contributions).
-	Growth Analysis: Identified the top 5 regional heads with the highest growth in sales from 2013 to 2014, highlighting positive performance trends (Dashboard 2 specifically focuses on this growth comparison).
